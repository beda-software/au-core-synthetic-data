# AU Core Synthetic Data

Data generated by Synthea then mapped to be valid according to AU Core IG

## Pipeline

1. Generate Data: Use dockerized Synthea and a custom module to generate data in CSV format.
2. Map/Post-Process CSV Files:
  1. Map target patients to the generated patients (because it is not possible to assign specific patient IDs in Synthea data).
  2. Rename column names in the generated CSV files according to the mapping configuration.
  3. Rename the resulting CSV files based on the mapping configuration.
  4. Delete unused CSV files.
  5. Add additional columns to the generated CSV files to maintain a structure for the Csv2Fhir.
  6. Perform post-processing using the configuration to enrich the data, as Synthea has a limited number of fields.
3. Generate FHIR Resources: Use the Csv2Fhir application to convert CSV data into FHIR resources in JSON format.
4. Validate Results: Validate the generated FHIR resources using the official FHIR Validator CLI.
5. Create an Archive: Bundle the generated FHIR resources in both JSON and CSV formats into an archive.
